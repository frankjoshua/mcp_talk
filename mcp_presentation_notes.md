# Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Presentation Notes (Polished)

## Core Narrative

**Key message:**

> The real bottleneck isn’t GPU FLOPS anymore—it’s getting the right context and the right tools to the model at the right moment.

- Yesterday’s arms race was raw compute.
- Today’s is **context plumbing**: collecting, filtering, and streaming the right data **just in time**.
- Tools aren’t accessories—they’re how the model actually *does things*, not just talks about them.

---

## Tools as Context

- **Two sides of the same coin**
  - *Context providers*: supply state—calendar events, repo contents, sensor feeds.
  - *Tool providers*: change state—create an issue, deploy a model, move a robot arm.
  - Both are required for truly active AI.
- **Every tool call is fresh context**
  - The instant a tool runs, it creates new state the model must immediately “see.”
  - Without a standard like MCP, that loop is brittle and slow.

---

## Why This Matters Now

- **Scaling real agency**
  - Models can read a million tokens, but usefulness comes from being able to **act**: write code, trigger CI/CD, schedule meetings.
- **From Q&A to Do & Decide**
  - Code interpreter and function calling hinted at the future.
  - MCP makes it a cross-vendor, secure, real-time standard.
- **Composable intelligence**
  - Tools chain together higher-level reasoning:
    - “Summarize this repo → open a PR → deploy to staging.”

---

## Architectural View

- **Automatic tool discovery**
  - The model negotiates capabilities as context changes.
- **Security & governance**
  - Fine-grained permissions, audit logs, and sandboxing for every tool call.
- **State synchronization**
  - Each action mutates world state, which must flow back without blowing up the token count.

## Suggested 10-Slide Outline

1. **Context Is the New Compute**
   - Yesterday: compute arms race (CPUs → GPUs).
   - Today: delivering *just-in-time* context is the real race.
   - Visual: timeline from FLOPS to context.

2. **From Static Answers to Active Agents**
   - Q&A is solved; action is next.
   - Models must read, decide, and **do**.
   - Visual: model reaching out to tools.

3. **Tools = Dynamic Context**
   - Tool calls create new state → new context.
   - Without MCP, that loop is fragile.
   - Visual: feedback flow.

4. **The Compounding Power of Tool Use**
   - Intelligence grows not by bigger brains but by better tools.
   - From humans to LLMs, every leap forward comes from extending what the core mind can reach.
   - **Humans:** writing → science → computers → internet.
   - **LLMs:** memory → APIs → specialty models → real-world actuators.
   - Each tool amplifies and layers on the next, creating a positive-feedback loop of capability.
   - The real frontier isn’t raw FLOPS—it’s connecting models to the right tools at the right moment.
   - **Key takeaway:** Tool use turns context into the new compute, compounding intelligence far beyond what standalone models—or humans—can achieve.

5. **MCP = Tools (Definition Slide)**
   - At its core, MCP is a universal way for AI to **use tools**.
   - Think of MCP as the connective tissue that lets a model reach beyond itself.
   - Simple message: **MCP == Tools**
   - Visual: bold text MCP = Tools with arrows to examples like memory, APIs, specialty models, robotics.

6. **Introducing MCP**
   - Explains how MCP goes beyond simple API calls by providing a consistent, vendor-neutral framework.
   - Handles automatic tool discovery and capability negotiation.
   - Supports live, bi-directional updates without custom integration work for every new tool.
   - Visual: protocol schematic showing MCP as a standard layer above traditional APIs.

8. **Example MCP Tools in Action**
   - **Productivity & Collaboration**: create and assign tasks, update documents, book meetings.
   - **Data & Knowledge Access**: query live databases, fetch the latest market or weather data, search internal wikis.
   - **Infrastructure & DevOps**: deploy code, restart servers, run CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Customer & Business Operations**: manage support tickets, process orders, update CRM.
   - **Robotics & IoT**: control sensors, move robotic arms, adjust smart building systems.
   - **Memory & Specialized Models**: store long-term memory for conversations, call more powerful or specialty models (e.g., legal, medical, or high‑compute tasks) when needed.

9. **Scaling the Compute Layer**
   - Fan-out to many providers and models.
   - Streaming diffs + backpressure control token costs.

10. **Business & Ecosystem Impact**
   - No vendor lock-in.
   - Open marketplace of reusable providers.
   - Visual: ecosystem diagram.

11. **Call to Action**
   - Build MCP endpoints.
   - Contribute providers.
   - Visual: bold tagline *“Context + Tools = Compute.”*

## Abstracts

**Conference style:**

> As LLMs move from question-answering into real decision-making, raw compute is no longer the constraint.\
> The hard part is delivering the right context and actionable tools at the right time.\
> This talk shows how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) makes context and tools first-class citizens—standardizing discovery, function calls, and live state updates.\
> You’ll see why *context is the new compute* and how MCP enables models that don’t just answer, but **act**.

**Short & casual:**

> Big models can think fast, but only if we feed them the right context and give them tools to act.\
> MCP is an open way to stream live data and call real-world tools—turning context itself into a new kind of compute.\
> Whether you code, manage, or just love AI, this is how chat turns into action.

## The Core Idea in One Line

> “Getting the right data to the model at the right time is now as critical as the math inside the GPU. That’s why we say *context is the new compute*.”

## Limits of Scaling & Why Tools Matter (Marketing View)

**The big picture:**

- We’ve reached a turning point. Making bigger and bigger models is giving us less and less in return.
- The world’s supply of fresh, high‑quality text and code isn’t infinite, and simply adding more hardware won’t fix that.
- Training ever-larger models is costly and complex, and the payoff is shrinking.

**Why this points to tools and MCP:**

- **Smarter, not just bigger:** Instead of memorizing everything, models can call tools and tap into live data exactly when needed.
- **Action is the new intelligence:** Great AI isn’t just about knowledge—it’s about *doing things* like scheduling, summarizing, or triggering real-world events.
- **Immediate feedback loops:** Every tool call creates new information that the model can instantly use, keeping it relevant and responsive.
- **Safe and open connections:** MCP provides a secure, vendor-neutral way to connect these tools and data sources.

**Key takeaway for a non-technical audience:**

> Scaling raw compute has natural limits. The next leap forward comes from giving AI the ability to work with live context and real tools—precisely what MCP makes possible.
