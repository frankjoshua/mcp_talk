## What Is MCP?

MCP is a way for AI to work with the tools you already use.  
Right now, most AIs just talk ‚Äî you ask something, it answers.  
MCP lets them actually do things ‚Äî plug into your calendar, notes, files, or gadgets to help directly.

## What MCP Is?

![width:600px](images/mcp-simple-diagram.avif)

- A **standard way** for AI models to connect to real-world tools and data  
- Think of it as a **universal adapter** between models and apps  
- Lets AI safely read info (like calendars or docs) and take action (like creating issues or sending reports)

## How Do LLMs Use Tools

- LLMs have no true memory ‚Äî context must be fed back in.  
- Tool calls are just structured text responses interpreted by the host app.

---

## The Protocol

- MCP returns structured responses describing:
  - **Tools**
  - **Resources**
  - **Prompts**
- It‚Äôs the language that lets AIs and apps communicate cleanly.

---

## How It Works

1. **MCP Server** lists available tools and data schemas  
2. **LLM** chooses the right tool and fills in inputs  
3. **App** executes the call via the MCP server ‚Üí returns results  
4. **Model** uses that output to continue reasoning  

**Example Flow:**  
> User: ‚ÄúCreate a GitHub issue‚Äù  
> ‚Üí Model calls `create_issue(title, body)`  
> ‚Üí MCP executes ‚Üí returns link  
> ‚Üí Model replies: ‚ÄúIssue created: [link]‚Äù

---

## Why It Matters

- No more custom integrations ‚Äî one shared language for all AI tools  
- Already widely supported across AI platforms

---

## The Compounding Power of Tool Use

- Intelligence grows not by bigger brains but by better tools.  
- **Humans:** writing ‚Üí science ‚Üí computers ‚Üí internet  
- **LLMs:** memory ‚Üí APIs ‚Üí specialty models ‚Üí real-world actuators  
- Each tool amplifies capability, creating a feedback loop.  
- **Key takeaway:** Connecting models to tools multiplies what AI can do.

## MCP = Tools (Definition Slide)

- At its core, MCP is a universal way for AI to **use tools.**  
- Think of it as the connective tissue letting a model reach beyond itself.  
- Simple message: **MCP == Tools**  
- Visual: bold text MCP = Tools ‚Üí memory, APIs, robotics, specialty models
